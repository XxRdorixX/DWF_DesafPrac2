# Book API - Living Letters

A RESTful web service developed with Spring Boot to manage the books of the fiction publishing house "Letras Vivas."
This API allows clients to perform basic operations such as listing, adding, searching, and deleting books.
The project follows a layered architecture and professional coding practices.
In our first project, it only managed a library; the system allows CRUD operations for creating, reading, updating, and deleting. But now, with the new additions, the system includes validations, error handling, the use of Hibernate and Spring Data, and Swagger documentation.

## Swagger / OpenAPI Documentation

After running the application, the interactive documentation is available at:

Swagger UI: http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui/index.html

OpenAPI JSON: http://localhost:8081/v3/api-docs

Compared to Postman in Swagger, we won't have to type the above in each GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, as the options are already pre-made.

To do this, simply copy the link and it will redirect to Swagger with all the options. For example, in POST /api/books, click Try it out and we'll have our body already created. 
Just change the Title, Author, and publicationYear and click Execute. The information will be saved and can be seen in the H2 Console.
